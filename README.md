# mbgtk-python
This is a discord bot in python, made by me, Noer completely in python. No xNoerPlaysCodes/mbgtk is not going to be maintained anymore this is the new one :)

# How to use?
Download main.py and var.py and user_tickets.json
Then, start main.py using your preferred operating system syntax (ie Linux & Mac is `python3 ./main.py`, Windows is `python .\main.py` in powershell window)
