# mbgtk-python
Rewrite of MBGTK (xNoerPlaysCodes/mbgtk) but in python.
It's basically a discord bot rewrite in python, since I'm learning python.
Yes, I'm abandoning MBGTK the Java Version. I cannot maintain it simply for the fact that it is too damn complicated, Java is not for me anymore. Python is easier, I'll use that instead.

Yeah I have to use my arch enemy but it's ok ðŸ˜­

# How to use?
Download main.py and var.py and user_tickets.json
Then, start main.py using your preferred operating system syntax (ie Linux & Mac is `python3 ./main.py`, Windows is `python .\main.py` in powershell window)
