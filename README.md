# mbgtk-python
Rewrite of MBGTK (xNoerPlaysCodes/mbgtk) but in python.
It's basically a discord bot rewrite in python, since I'm learning python.
Yes, I'm abandoning MBGTK the Java Version. I cannot maintain it simply for the fact that it is too damn complicated, Java is not for me anymore. Python is easier, I'll use that instead.

Yeah I have to use my arch enemy but it's ok ðŸ˜­
